In this final project, I needed to create, using the Java programming language, the internal system of the university. The functionality of the program was supposed to allow the user to act as a student, teacher, manager of the registrar's office, technical support agent, administrator.

In the file "Final project report.pdf" you can see a short report of all the work done. The file "Final project (functionality) .pdf" shows all the functionality of my program. Also look at the rest of the files, as they also contain equally interesting information about how the project logic works.
